# Description

Remember the card game "War"?

Two players start the game by splitting a deck of 52 standard playing cards
evenly. Each pile is facedown, and players cannot look at the cards in their
piles or rearrange them.

To play, each player reveals the top card in their pile. The player who played
the card with the higher value (Aces high) takes both cards and puts them at the
bottom of their deck in an arbitray order.

If there is a tie, then it's War! In the card game each player adds places the
top three cards of their deck face down, and then each player reveals the top
card again. Whoever wins out of the second reveal takes all of the cards, and if
there is another tie the process repeats until there is a winner.

(Don't worry, for MVP we simplify how to handle a tie.)

## Prerequisites

- Topics with which developers should be familiar with.
- Prerequisites are "just-in-time", so if I have a prerequisite that mentions
  Sass, I would **not** need to include CSS as a prerequisite.
- [Links to previous materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) are
  often useful.
- In a challenge, it is useful to link to reference material, such as talk
  repositories.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Change into the new directory.
3. Install dependencies.
4. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## Requirements

Describe behavioral requirements as you'll be using them in tests. That is, list
requirements in language that describes how the written code will be used, not
how it will be written, with the exception of constraints you may wish to place
on implementation. It's a good idea to include the below paragraph verbatim.

## Bonus

Bonuses are described after the requirements, if included. They should be worked
on **only after** passing requirements.

Less experienced students should be able to complete the base requirements in
the alloted time for labs and in around 2 hours for homework; more experienced
students should be to complete the bonus.

Sometimes, we ask questions that promote thinking critically about code.
